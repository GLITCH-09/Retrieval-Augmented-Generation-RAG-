# Local-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that grants generative artificial intelligence models information retrieval capabilities. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to augment information drawn from its own vast, static training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or giving factual information only from an authoritative source.
